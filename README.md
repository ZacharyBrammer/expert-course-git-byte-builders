# Team git exercise
The team lead should fork this repo, and add each team member as contributors.
Have each member choose a function to implement, create their own branch, and commit their changes.
Then each member should push their changes to a remote branch, and open a pull request.
The lead should confirm the function is working properly and then merge it in.
### The team who implements and merges all functions first wins!!
